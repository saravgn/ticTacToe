## Game Description:

-----------------------------------
Tic-tac-toe noughts and crosses or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3x3 grid, or four in a row in a 4x4 grid.
X always goes first.

Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either (a) one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally; or (b) all nine squares are filled.
If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, that player wins.
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

Tic Tac Toe can be also be played on a 5x5 grid with each player trying to get five in a row.
The game can also be played on larger grids, such as 10x10 or even 20x20. For any grid of 6x6 or larger, I recommend sticking to a goal of getting five in a row.
